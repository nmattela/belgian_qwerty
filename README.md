# Belgian QWERTY
A QWERTY keyboard layout with support for French, German, and Dutch diacritics, as well as other diacritics, common Greek letters, and mathematical symbols

## “Installation”
Replace the file `be` from this repository with the existing `be` file in `/usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols`. Reload Xorg by opening the command prompt using Alt+F2 and typing 'r'. Then, in the settings (at least on Ubuntu), you can find the Belgian keyboard layout under French. It is simply called "Belgian".
